## 2026-02-17 - [Timer Localization and useCallback Hoisting]
**Learning:** Moving a state update from a parent component to a localized child component (like a Timer) significantly reduces re-renders of the parent and its other children. However, if the final value of that state is needed by another component (like ScoreScreen), it must be captured correctly at the transition point (e.g., in handleSubmit). Also, wrapping functions in `useCallback` can break code if they are used before declaration, as `const` variables are not hoisted. Functional updates in `setState` should be used to minimize `useCallback` dependencies.
**Action:** Always place `useCallback` definitions before they are referenced in other hooks or functions. Use functional updates in `setState` where possible. Be careful not to commit `package-lock.json` if using `npm install` in a sandbox.
